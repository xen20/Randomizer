This QT-based program returns a random set of files of a given type (e.g Music, Videos, or Folders) and may also copy the
returned files to a given destination. Useful for people with large media libraries (especially music) and allows one to vary
their media consumption by taking away choice from them - the closest equivalent is the "shuffle" option in any music player.

Program is complete with a selection log (so returned results are not repeated), and remembers the latest user options.
